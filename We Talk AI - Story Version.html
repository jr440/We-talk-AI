          <h1>We Talk AI</h1>
          <h2>I Can't Talk to Humans, But I Can Talk to Computers</h2>
          <p><strong>Since 1990, people said I think "like a computer." Turns out, that's exactly what you need for AI.</strong></p>
          <p>You want something done? Tell me. I'll figure out how to ask AI.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- The Story -->
      <div class="section">
          <h2>How This Started: The DJ Story</h2>
          <div class="story-box">
              <p><strong>An older gentleman at PLE needed help.</strong> He had a video of his DJ equipment but couldn't figure out what Bluetooth dongle he needed. Staff couldn't help after 45+ minutes.</p>
              
              <p><strong>I'm not a DJ.</strong> But I knew how to ask AI the right questions. Used my phone's AI to analyze his video. Found the exact equipment model in under 5 minutes.</p>
              
              <p><strong>That's when it hit me:</strong> "What if I became the bridge between people who need help and AI that can provide it?"</p>
          </div>
          
          <p><span class="highlight">I realized my ASD "computer brain" is actually perfect for this.</span> I struggle talking to humans, but I can talk to computers. And that's exactly what AI needs.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- The Problem I Solve -->
      <div class="section">
          <h2>The Problem: People Are Scared of AI</h2>
          <ul>

              <li><strong>Business owners:</strong> Know they need AI but don't know how</li>
              <li><strong>Regular people:</strong> Want help but don't know how to ask AI properly</li>
              <li><strong>Everyone:</strong> Gets frustrated with AI giving wrong answers</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>The solution?</strong> Someone who speaks both Human and Computer. That's me.</p>

          <div class="story-box">
              <p><strong>"You think like a computer"</strong> - What people told me in 1990</p>

              <p><strong>Now:</strong> That's exactly what AI communication needs</p>
